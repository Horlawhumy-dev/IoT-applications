Topic: Internet of Things IoT, and its Applications

The history of the internet could be dated back to 1920 from the evolvement of fundamental information theory originated by - 'Claude Shannon'. The theoretical work of this advancement was developed by two core scientific researchers named Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley in the United States of America.   

According to a research-based company WIKIPEDIA, IoT was defined as "The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices, systems over the internet or other communications networks".

Computer Science was the area of technological coursework that emerged in the discipline of the internet in the late 1950s. Many networks led to the discovery but the recent ones are the transmission control protocol(TCP) and the internet protocol(IP). The two protocols are the suite of communication used to ensure the interconnection of network devices on the internet.

Network protocols help in the exchange of serial data sent between particular end-to-end communication within a sub-range of areas. This is also based on the distance between devices seeking connection to the subnet or the network provider device. Examples are the wide-area network, local area network, metropolitan area network, and some others.

Referring to the definition of IoT above, any objects developed or mounted on top of the internet and can reference the pre-defined networks for the exchange of data packets are meant IOTs. In this article, I will reference the very part of technology as a service(TAAS) which is software applications.

Software is a system application program developed for the configuration, smooth running of systems that solves a real-world problem. Every operating system mounted on top systems are instances of software applications such as your Android, Windows, Linux, and some others.  Computers run the software program and translate the output for users through the screen, printing, etc.

Furthermore, there are many segments of software mixed before any application can be packaged as software for use. Every software goes through the SDLC architecture i.e Software Development lifecycle. This lifecycle has to do with varieties of steps - from planning,  coding, testing, deploying, monitoring, and operating. 

Industrial wise, this software can be mobile, web, and desktop applications. There are three paths of developing every application which are the designing mode, user-interface (Frontend) mode, and server-side (Backend). Those that specialize in design are the product designers, the frontend developers ensure the user interface and experience, while those that deal with the server configuration are the backend and cloud engineers. 

Programming languages used to develop the software are enormous, and the popular ones are - Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, Rust, etc. The software capable of designing products is - Adobe XD, Figma, etc. Commonly used integrated environments, IDEs for software development are VSCode, Atom, Sublime, Intellij, Pycharm, and more. 

The good news is that "nobody owns the internet and is free for all." So feel free to dive into this area if interested.
